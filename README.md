# Tools-of-software-projects - Wash out!

## Hi there!
### We are team Wash out! and this is our welcoming speech.

First of all, let us introduce ourselves: our names are Márton, Bence and Eszter, currently we are in our 3rd year in the Faculty of Informatics. Our temperament is quite different from each other, we are interested in different areas.

**Marci** likes artistic things beyond programming, that's why he will have a big role in our project's graphical design.

**Bence** is currently working beyond school and because of it, he can add some important practical thing to our project.

**Eszter** is the "Math-head" in our team, as she's in Modelling specialization she sees a lot of numbers every day.

### Get to know our project!
_**In the beginning...**_

Our main idea is from the life in a dormitory because two of us are currently living in Kőrösi Csoma Sándor Dormitory, but every one of the group members knows that a simple task like washing your clothes can be very stressful when some people don't follow the rules.
When we created our team, we started to think. We had other tiny ideas, but we were sure all along that we want to bring this idea to life in this semester. We got our name as an inspirational idea from Eszter.

**What are we doing exactly?**

In our project we want to make a washing machine booking system, which will improve dormitory students' life so much easier, at least we hope it will.
We had to think about the implementation because we wanted to include some extra features which make this project better than an ordinary Excel spreadsheet.

**In the end, we had our idea in our minds, which needs nothing, but:**

- a website
- 3 diligent students

Combining these, at the end of the semester we would like to have a well-done website with a lot of useful information, but in a very simple and modern way which provides the following functions: book/delete/change appointment and time.
We aspire during our project that this idea is used by a dormitory, and we using the dormitory's database with its help.

Our goal is to make our project as great in real life as in our minds and we are ready to make everything we can to achieve it.
